# Gina's Bed & Breakfast - LD40
This is a game entry to [Ludum Dare 40](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40).
The goal was to make a game in 48 hours based off of the theme, "the more you have, the worse it is".

## Storyline
You just woke up at Gina's Bed & Breakfast in time to eat.
You realize that you are starting to gain weight, and decide to take a morning stroll to burn calories.
You can't take it much longer after being forced to eat burgers, and you don't know if you will continue to live.

## How to play
Explore on your mission to eat healthier.
Use the arrow keys (or WASD) on a computer or swipe on a mobile device to move around the room.
Follow the storyline within the gameplay to complete the game.

## Inspiration
**Theme**: The idea came to my mind instantly: the more unhealthy food you eat, the worse it is.
This was a simple idea and I thought it would be easy to make.

**Game**:
I was inspired to make this game based off of a terrible experience on a family vacation.
My family was going to stay at a motel on one of the nights.
It was terribly unorganized (keeping track of rooms was done on paper),
so both of our rooms were occupied, leaving us with two other rooms.
One of the rooms didn't lock, and the other room had someone's stuff in it.
The cook quit that morning, leaving another person to cook meals,
who happened to be only able to cook burgers (even for breakfast).
